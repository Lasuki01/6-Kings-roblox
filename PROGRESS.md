- Spawned 4 corner torches in the Castle Keep floor for subtle warm illumination.

**What was removed:**

**Branch:** `main`
**Type:** 🗺️ Map Bugfix

**What was added:**
- Moved the physical solid `DragonGate` part from the Z=200 spawn point to the Z=47 Castle Keep entrance to prevent players from being blocked at the spawn portal.
- Configured portal plane orientations facing along the path directions.
- Adjusted the `ParticleEmitter` to emit outwards (`Enum.NormalId.Front`) with an increased rate of 75 and initial speed of 4-9 to make the portals look highly active and magical.

**What was removed:**
- Solid gate block at spawn point.

**Rollbacks:** None

**Notes:** Dragon gate still blocks path until Wave 10, but at the Keep entrance instead of spawn point.

---

### v0.3.8 — Themed Glowing Spawn Gates and Portals
**Date:** June 2026
**GitHub Commit:** `feat: implement themed glowing spawn gates with portal particle effects`
**Branch:** `main`

- Reduced waypoint counts for both paths from 6 to 5, matching the Dragon Pass layout exactly.
- Unified `rampStartIdx` to `3` for all paths.
- Symmetrized pedestal generation so all paths spawn 4 pedestals on Segment 1 and 2 pedestals on Segment 2, yielding 6 pedestals total.
- Aligned spawn gatehouses, fences, tombstones, and torches symmetrically along the straightened roads.

**What was removed:**
- Turn waypoints on Forest and Undead paths.

**Rollbacks:** None

**Notes:** All three ingress paths are now perfectly straight and balanced.

- Relocated the destructible `"DragonGate"` portcullis wall to the main spawn portal at `Z = 200`.
- Closed the volcanic portal at the spawn point using the gate, and opened up the checkpoint at `Z = 120` to allow players to traverse the entire road.

**What was removed:**
- Removed the second gatehouse checkpoint structure at `Z = 120`.

- Positioned all placement pedestals (sandstone blocks) flanking path midpoints and segment intervals, parallel and symmetrical to the road borders.
- Dynamically aligned environmental details parallel to path directions (hills and fences for Forest, tombstones and slate crosses for Graveyard, lava cracks and basalt columns for Dragon Pass).
- Added rotation alignment to fences, tombstones, and cracks so they run parallel to path lines.
- Refined watchtower peak coordinates and castle wall crenellations.
